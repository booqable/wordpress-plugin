**Booqable** is a new way to rent out products on WordPress.

Whether you let your customers make a reservation or request a quote; treat them to a beautiful booking experience with Booqable’s rental plugin.

*Prevent overbooking*
As you accept rental reservations on your website, the plugin automatically adjusts the availability of your items (optional).

*Secure shopping cart*
Add a secure shopping cart to WordPress. Define fixed rental durations, time slots, business hours, and more to match your workflow.

*Accept online payments*
Use the Stripe and PayPal integrations to accept payments and charge damage deposits, or don’t charge at all to let your customers request a quote.

*Coupon codes*
Offer discounts by creating coupon codes that customers can redeem at checkout.

*Embed a date picker*
Add a separate date picker to your website and let customers see real-time availability as they choose a period.

*Customize and translate*
Gain full control over product descriptions, colors, and translations.

*Works with any theme*
The rental plugin is fully responsive and works perfectly with any theme, on any device, even alongside e-commerce platforms like WooCommerce.

*Get started in minutes*
Just install the plugin, add your products to any page or post, and you’re ready to accept online rental reservations.
