**Online bookings for rental businesses.** Booqable is the all-in-one rental software for any rental business and industry. Whether you accept reservations in advance or take rental requests, start accepting reservations using your WordPress website with Booqable.

### Embed products
Present your products exactly how you want on any page or post. Booqable generates the embed codes to show individual products, product lists, or add buttons to existing product pages. 

### Show multiple images
Show your customers what your products look like, choose a thumbnail, and set a focal point. Perfect for showcasing detailed shots and different angles, so customers know what they are going to rent.

### Flexible date picker
Control the selectable period to match your rental operation. Set up fixed durations and time-slots, prevent last-minute reservations, and set up business hours to create a seamless booking experience. 

### Secure shopping cart and checkout
Add a secure, frictionless checkout experience to your WordPress website, and capture all the information you need from customers by creating custom checkout fields.

### Optional real-time availability
Don't worry about availability conflicts and double bookings. Display product availability in real-time as customers select a rental period, and track your inventory in Booqable. Your online and in-store channels are always in sync, without any manual work.

### Advanced pricing rules
No matter how you charge for rentals, Booqable offers flexible pricing options. Charge flat-fee rates, fixed fees, pricing structures, and create advanced pricing rules for seasonal and weekend pricing. 

### Accept payments with Stripe and PayPal
Start taking payments with Booqable. Let your customers pay with their preferred payment method by accepting credit cards, PayPal, and many local payment methods. Additionally, you can charge security deposits and capture partial payments.

Increase conversions and keep customers coming back by offering coupon codes. Offer percentage and fixed-value discounts that customers can redeem online and in-store.
